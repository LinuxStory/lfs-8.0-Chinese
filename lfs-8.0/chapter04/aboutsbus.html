      </h1>
      <p>
        Many people would like to know beforehand approximately how long it
        takes to compile and install each package. Because Linux From Scratch
        can be built on many different systems, it is impossible to provide
        accurate time estimates. The biggest package (Glibc) will take
        approximately 20 minutes on the fastest systems, but could take up to
        three days on slower systems! Instead of providing actual times, the
        Standard Build Unit (SBU) measure will be used instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SBU measure works as follows. The first package to be compiled
        from this book is Binutils in <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>.
        The time it takes to compile this package is what will be referred to
        as the Standard Build Unit or SBU. All other compile times will be
        expressed relative to this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, consider a package whose compilation time is 4.5 SBUs.
        This means that if a system took 10 minutes to compile and install
        the first pass of Binutils, it will take <span class=
        "emphasis"><em>approximately</em></span> 45 minutes to build this
        example package. Fortunately, most build times are shorter than the
        one for Binutils.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, SBUs are not entirely accurate because they depend on
        many factors, including the host system's version of GCC. They are
        provided here to give an estimate of how long it might take to
        install a package, but the numbers can vary by as much as dozens of
        minutes in some cases.
      </p>

        <h3>
          Note
        </h3>
        <p>
          For many modern systems with multiple processors (or cores) the
          compilation time for a package can be reduced by performing a
          "parallel make" by either setting an environment variable or
          telling the <span class="command"><strong>make</strong></span>
          program how many processors are available. For instance, a Core2Duo
          can support two simultaneous processes with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">export MAKEFLAGS='-j 2'</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          or just building with:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">make -j2</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          When multiple processors are used in this way, the SBU units in the
          book will vary even more than they normally would. In some cases,
          the make step will simply fail. Analyzing the output of the build
          process will also be more difficult because the lines of different
          processes will be interleaved. If you run into a problem with a
          build step, revert back to a single processor build to properly
          analyze the error messages.
