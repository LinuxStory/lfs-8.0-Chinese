          7.6.1. How Do the System V Bootscripts Work?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Linux uses a special booting facility named SysVinit that is based
          on a concept of <span class="emphasis"><em>run-levels</em></span>.
          It can be quite different from one system to another, so it cannot
          be assumed that because things worked in one particular Linux
          distribution, they should work the same in LFS too. LFS has its own
          way of doing things, but it respects generally accepted standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          SysVinit (which will be referred to as <span class=
          "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">init</span>&rdquo;</span> from
          now on) works using a run-levels scheme. There are seven (numbered
          0 to 6) run-levels (actually, there are more run-levels, but they
          are for special cases and are generally not used. See <code class=
          "filename">init(8)</code> for more details), and each one of those
          corresponds to the actions the computer is supposed to perform when
          it starts up. The default run-level is 3. Here are the descriptions
          of the different run-levels as they are implemented:

        <p>
          An explanation of this initialization file is in the man page for
          <span class="emphasis"><em>inittab</em></span>. For LFS, the key
          command that is run is <span class=
          "command"><strong>rc</strong></span>. The initialization file above
          will instruct <span class="command"><strong>rc</strong></span> to
          run all the scripts starting with an S in the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/rc.d/rcS.d</code> directory followed by all the
          scripts starting with an S in the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/rc.d/rc?.d</code> directory where the question mark
          is specified by the initdefault value.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a convenience, the <span class=
          "command"><strong>rc</strong></span> script reads a library of
          functions in <code class="filename">/lib/lsb/init-functions</code>.
          This library also reads an optional configuration file,
          <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</code>. Any of the
          system configuration file parameters described in subsequent
          sections can be alternatively placed in this file allowing
          consolidation of all system parameters in this one file.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a debugging convenience, the functions script also logs all
          output to <code class="filename">/run/var/bootlog</code>. Since the
          <code class="filename">/run</code> directory is a tmpfs, this file
          is not persistent across boots, however it is appended to the more
          permanent file <code class="filename">/var/log/boot.log</code> at
          the end of the boot process.

            <a id="init-levels" name="init-levels"></a>7.6.2.1. Changing Run
            Levels
          </h3>
          <p>
            Changing run-levels is done with <span class=
            "command"><strong>init <em class=
            "replaceable"><code>&lt;runlevel&gt;</code></em></strong></span>,
            where <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;runlevel&gt;</code></em>
            is the target run-level. For example, to reboot the computer, a
            user could issue the <span class="command"><strong>init
            6</strong></span> command, which is an alias for the <span class=
            "command"><strong>reboot</strong></span> command. Likewise,
            <span class="command"><strong>init 0</strong></span> is an alias
            for the <span class="command"><strong>halt</strong></span>
            command.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a number of directories under <code class=
            "filename">/etc/rc.d</code> that look like <code class=
            "filename">rc?.d</code> (where ? is the number of the run-level)
            and <code class="filename">rcsysinit.d</code>, all containing a
            number of symbolic links. Some begin with a <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>K</em></span>, the others begin with an
            <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span>, and all of them have
            two numbers following the initial letter. The K means to stop
            (kill) a service and the S means to start a service. The numbers
            determine the order in which the scripts are run, from 00 to
            99&mdash;the lower the number the earlier it gets executed. When
            <span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span> switches to
            another run-level, the appropriate services are either started or
            stopped, depending on the runlevel chosen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real scripts are in <code class=
            "filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d</code>. They do the actual work, and
            the symlinks all point to them. K links and S links point to the
            same script in <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d</code>.
            This is because the scripts can be called with different
            parameters like <em class="parameter"><code>start</code></em>,
            <em class="parameter"><code>stop</code></em>, <em class=
            "parameter"><code>restart</code></em>, <em class=
            "parameter"><code>reload</code></em>, and <em class=
            "parameter"><code>status</code></em>. When a K link is
            encountered, the appropriate script is run with the <em class=
            "parameter"><code>stop</code></em> argument. When an S link is
            encountered, the appropriate script is run with the <em class=
            "parameter"><code>start</code></em> argument.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is one exception to this explanation. Links that start with
            an <span class="emphasis"><em>S</em></span> in the <code class=
            "filename">rc0.d</code> and <code class="filename">rc6.d</code>
            directories will not cause anything to be started. They will be
            called with the parameter <em class=
            "parameter"><code>stop</code></em> to stop something. The logic
            behind this is that when a user is going to reboot or halt the
            system, nothing needs to be started. The system only needs to be
            stopped.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are descriptions of what the arguments make the scripts do:

          7.6.3. Udev Bootscripts

          The <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev</code> initscript
          starts <span class="command"><strong>udevd</strong></span>,
          triggers any "coldplug" devices that have already been created by
          the kernel and waits for any rules to complete. The script also
          unsets the uevent handler from the default of <code class=
          "filename">/sbin/hotplug</code> . This is done because the kernel
          no longer needs to call out to an external binary. Instead
          <span class="command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will listen on
          a netlink socket for uevents that the kernel raises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class=
          "command"><strong>/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev_retry</strong></span>
          initscript takes care of re-triggering events for subsystems whose
          rules may rely on filesystems that are not mounted until the
          <span class="command"><strong>mountfs</strong></span> script is run
          (in particular, <code class="filename">/usr</code> and <code class=
          "filename">/var</code> may cause this). This script runs after the
          <span class="command"><strong>mountfs</strong></span> script, so
          those rules (if re-triggered) should succeed the second time
          around. It is configured from the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/udev_retry</code> file; any words in this
          file other than comments are considered subsystem names to trigger
          at retry time. To find the subsystem of a device, use <span class=
          "command"><strong>udevadm info --attribute-walk
          &lt;device&gt;</strong></span> where &lt;device&gt; is an absolute
          path in /dev or /sys such as /dev/sr0 or /sys/class/rtc.

            7.6.3.1. Module Loading
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into
            them. Aliases are visible in the output of the <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> program and are usually
            related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices supported by a
            module. For example, the <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span> driver supports PCI devices
            with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of
            <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</span>&rdquo;</span>.
            For most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver
            that would handle the device via <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. E.g., the <code class=
            "filename">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</code> file
            might contain the string <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</span>&rdquo;</span>.
            The default rules provided with Udev will cause <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> to call out to
            <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe</strong></span> with
            the contents of the <code class="envar">MODALIAS</code> uevent
            environment variable (which should be the same as the contents of
            the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in sysfs), thus
            loading all modules whose aliases match this string after
            wildcard expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, this means that, in addition to <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
            <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> driver will be
            loaded if it is available. See below for ways in which the
            loading of unwanted drivers can be prevented.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kernel itself is also able to load modules for network
            protocols, filesystems and NLS support on demand.

          hardware clock is set to UTC, this script will convert the hardware
          clock's time to the local time using the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/localtime</code> file (which tells the <span class=
          "command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> program which timezone
          the user is in). There is no way to detect whether or not the
          hardware clock is set to UTC, so this needs to be configured
          manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="command"><strong>setclock</strong></span> is run
          via <span class="application">udev</span> when the kernel detects
          the hardware capability upon boot. It can also be run manually with
          the stop parameter to store the system time to the CMOS clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you cannot remember whether or not the hardware clock is set to
          UTC, find out by running the <strong class=
          "userinput"><code>hwclock --localtime --show</code></strong>
          command. This will display what the current time is according to
          the hardware clock. If this time matches whatever your watch says,
          then the hardware clock is set to local time. If the output from
          <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span> is not local
          time, chances are it is set to UTC time. Verify this by adding or
          subtracting the proper amount of hours for the timezone to the time
          shown by <span class="command"><strong>hwclock</strong></span>. For
          example, if you are currently in the MST timezone, which is also
          known as GMT -0700, add seven hours to the local time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Change the value of the <code class="envar">UTC</code> variable
          below to a value of <em class="parameter"><code>0</code></em>
          (zero) if the hardware clock is <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>not</em></span> set to UTC time.

          Configuring the Linux Console
        </h2>
        <p>
          This section discusses how to configure the <span class=
          "command"><strong>console</strong></span> bootscript that sets up
          the keyboard map, console font and console kernel log level. If
          non-ASCII characters (e.g., the copyright sign, the British pound
          sign and Euro symbol) will not be used and the keyboard is a U.S.
          one, much of this section can be skipped. Without the configuration
          file, (or equivalent settings in <code class=
          "filename">rc.site</code>), the <span class=
          "command"><strong>console</strong></span> bootscript will do
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <span class="command"><strong>console</strong></span> script
          reads the <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/console</code> file
          for configuration information. Decide which keymap and screen font
          will be used. Various language-specific HOWTOs can also help with
          this, see <a class="ulink" href=
          "http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html">http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/other-lang.html</a>.
          If still in doubt, look in the <code class=
          "filename">/usr/share/keymaps</code> and <code class=
          "filename">/usr/share/consolefonts</code> directories for valid
          keymaps and screen fonts. Read <code class=
          "filename">loadkeys(1)</code> and <code class=
          "filename">setfont(8)</code> manual pages to determine the correct
          arguments for these programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/console</code> file
          should contain lines of the form: VARIABLE="value". The following
          variables are recognized:
        </p>
        <div class="variablelist">
          <dl class="variablelist">
            <dt>
              <span class="term">LOGLEVEL</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                This variable specifies the log level for kernel messages
                sent to the console as set by <span class=
                "command"><strong>dmesg</strong></span>. Valid levels are
                from "1" (no messages) to "8". The default level is "7".
              </p>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              <span class="term">KEYMAP</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                This variable specifies the arguments for the <span class=
                "command"><strong>loadkeys</strong></span> program,
                typically, the name of keymap to load, e.g., <span class=
                "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">it</span>&rdquo;</span>.
                If this variable is not set, the bootscript will not run the
                <span class="command"><strong>loadkeys</strong></span>
                program, and the default kernel keymap will be used. Note
                that a few keymaps have multiple versions with the same name
                (cz and its variants in qwerty/ and qwertz/, es in olpc/ and
                qwerty/, and trf in fgGIod/ and qwerty/). In these cases the
                parent directory should also be specified (e.g. qwerty/es) to
                ensure the proper keymap is loaded.
              </p>

            <dd>
              <p>
                This (rarely used) variable specifies the arguments for the
                second call to the <span class=
                "command"><strong>loadkeys</strong></span> program. This is
                useful if the stock keymap is not completely satisfactory and
                a small adjustment has to be made. E.g., to include the Euro
                sign into a keymap that normally doesn't have it, set this
                variable to <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
                "quote">euro2</span>&rdquo;</span>.
              </p>

              <span class="term">FONT</span>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                This variable specifies the arguments for the <span class=
                "command"><strong>setfont</strong></span> program. Typically,
                this includes the font name, <span class=
                "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">-m</span>&rdquo;</span>,
                and the name of the application character map to load. E.g.,
                in order to load the <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
                "quote">lat1-16</span>&rdquo;</span> font together with the
                <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
                "quote">8859-1</span>&rdquo;</span> application character map
                (as it is appropriate in the USA), set this variable to
                <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">lat1-16 -m
                8859-1</span>&rdquo;</span>. In UTF-8 mode, the kernel uses
                the application character map for conversion of composed
                8-bit key codes in the keymap to UTF-8, and thus the argument
                of the "-m" parameter should be set to the encoding of the
                composed key codes in the keymap.

                or <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
                "quote">true</span>&rdquo;</span> in order to put the console
                into UTF-8 mode. This is useful in UTF-8 based locales and
                harmful otherwise.

                For many keyboard layouts, there is no stock Unicode keymap
                in the Kbd package. The <span class=
                "command"><strong>console</strong></span> bootscript will
                convert an available keymap to UTF-8 on the fly if this
                variable is set to the encoding of the available non-UTF-8
                keymap.

                For a non-Unicode setup, only the KEYMAP and FONT variables
                are generally needed. E.g., for a Polish setup, one would

                As mentioned above, it is sometimes necessary to adjust a

                Some keymaps have dead keys (i.e., keys that don't produce a
                character by themselves, but put an accent on the character
                produced by the next key) or define composition rules (such
                as: <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">press
                Ctrl+. A E to get Æ</span>&rdquo;</span> in the default
                keymap). Linux-4.9.9 interprets dead keys and composition
                rules in the keymap correctly only when the source characters
                to be composed together are not multibyte. This deficiency
                doesn't affect keymaps for European languages, because there
                accents are added to unaccented ASCII characters, or two
                ASCII characters are composed together. However, in UTF-8
                mode it is a problem, e.g., for the Greek language, where one
                sometimes needs to put an accent on the letter <span class=
                "quote">&ldquo;<span class=

                avoid the use of UTF-8, or to install the X window system
                that doesn't have this limitation in its input handling.

        </h2>
        <p>
          The optional <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</code>
          file contains settings that are automatically set for each SystemV
          boot script. It can alternatively set the values specified in the
          <code class="filename">hostname</code>, <code class=
          "filename">console</code>, and <code class="filename">clock</code>
          files in the <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/</code>
          directory. If the associated variables are present in both these
          separate files and <code class="filename">rc.site</code>, the
          values in the script specific files have precedence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <code class="filename">rc.site</code> also contains parameters that
          can customize other aspects of the boot process. Setting the
          IPROMPT variable will enable selective running of bootscripts.
          Other options are described in the file comments. The default
          version of the file is as follows:

            7.6.8.1. Customizing the Boot and Shutdown Scripts
          </h3>
          <p>
            The LFS boot scripts boot and shut down a system in a fairly
            efficient manner, but there are a few tweaks that you can make in
            the rc.site file to improve speed even more and to adjust
            messages according to your preferences. To do this, adjust the
            settings in the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/sysconfig/rc.site</code> file above.
          </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
                  During the boot script <code class="filename">udev</code>,
                  there is a call to <span class="command"><strong>udev
                  settle</strong></span> that requires some time to complete.
                  This time may or may not be required depending on devices
                  present in the system. If you only have simple partitions
                  and a single ethernet card, the boot process will probably
                  not need to wait for this command. To skip it, set the
                  variable OMIT_UDEV_SETTLE=y.
                </p>

                  The boot script <code class="filename">udev_retry</code>
                  also runs <span class="command"><strong>udev
                  settle</strong></span> by default. This command is only
                  needed by default if the <code class="filename">/var</code>
                  directory is separately mounted. This is because the clock
                  needs the file <code class=
                  "filename">/var/lib/hwclock/adjtime</code>. Other
                  customizations may also need to wait for udev to complete,
                  but in many installations it is not needed. Skip the
                  command by setting the variable OMIT_UDEV_RETRY_SETTLE=y.

                <p>
                  By default, the file system checks are silent. This can
                  appear to be a delay during the bootup process. To turn on
                  the <span class="command"><strong>fsck</strong></span>
                  output, set the variable VERBOSE_FSCK=y.

              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
                  When rebooting, you may want to skip the filesystem check,
                  <span class="command"><strong>fsck</strong></span>,
                  completely. To do this, either create the file <code class=
                  "filename">/fastboot</code> or reboot the system with the
                  command <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/shutdown -f -r
                  now</strong></span>. On the other hand, you can force all
                  file systems to be checked by creating <code class=
                  "filename">/forcefsck</code> or running <span class=
                  "command"><strong>shutdown</strong></span> with the
                  <em class="parameter"><code>-F</code></em> parameter
                  instead of <em class="parameter"><code>-f</code></em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Setting the variable FASTBOOT=y will disable <span class=
                  "command"><strong>fsck</strong></span> during the boot
                  process until it is removed. This is not recommended on a
                  permanent basis.

                  Normally, all files in the <code class=
                  "filename">/tmp</code> directory are deleted at boot time.
                  Depending on the number of files or directories present,
                  this can cause a noticeable delay in the boot process. To
                  skip removing these files set the variable SKIPTMPCLEAN=y.

                  During shutdown, the <span class=
                  "command"><strong>init</strong></span> program sends a TERM
                  signal to each program it has started (e.g. agetty), waits
                  for a set time (default 3 seconds), and sends each process
                  a KILL signal and waits again. This process is repeated in
                  the <span class=
                  "command"><strong>sendsignals</strong></span> script for
                  any processes that are not shut down by their own scripts.
                  The delay for <span class=
                  "command"><strong>init</strong></span> can be set by
                  passing a parameter. For example to remove the delay in
                  <span class="command"><strong>init</strong></span>, pass
                  the -t0 parameter when shutting down or rebooting (e.g.
                  <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/shutdown -t0 -r
                  now</strong></span>). The delay for the <span class=
                  "command"><strong>sendsignals</strong></span> script can be
                  skipped by setting the parameter KILLDELAY=0.
