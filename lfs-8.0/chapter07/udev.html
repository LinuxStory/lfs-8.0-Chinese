        In <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter
        6</a>, we installed the Udev package when <span class=
        "phrase">eudev</span> was built. Before we go into the details
        regarding how this works, a brief history of previous methods of
        handling devices is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linux systems in general traditionally used a static device creation
        method, whereby a great many device nodes were created under
        <code class="filename">/dev</code> (sometimes literally thousands of
        nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices
        actually existed. This was typically done via a <span class=
        "command"><strong>MAKEDEV</strong></span> script, which contains a
        number of calls to the <span class=
        "command"><strong>mknod</strong></span> program with the relevant
        major and minor device numbers for every possible device that might
        exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the Udev method, only those devices which are detected by the
        kernel get device nodes created for them. Because these device nodes
        will be created each time the system boots, they will be stored on a
        <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code> file system (a virtual file
        system that resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not
        require much space, so the memory that is used is negligible.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="en" xml:lang="en">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          7.3.1. History
        </h2>
        <p>
          In February 2000, a new filesystem called <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was merged into the 2.3.46 kernel and was
          made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although it
          was present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating
          devices dynamically never received overwhelming support from the
          core kernel developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem with the approach adopted by <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was the way it handled device detection,
          creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node naming,
          was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if
          device names are allowed to be configurable, then the device naming
          policy should be up to a system administrator, not imposed on them
          by any particular developer(s). The <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> file system also suffered from race
          conditions that were inherent in its design and could not be fixed
          without a substantial revision to the kernel. It was marked as
          deprecated for a long period &ndash; due to a lack of maintenance
          &ndash; and was finally removed from the kernel in June, 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later
          released as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual
          filesystem called <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> came to be.
          The job of <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> is to export a
          view of the system's hardware configuration to userspace processes.
          With this userspace-visible representation, the possibility of
          developing a userspace replacement for <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> became much more realistic.

          <p>
            The <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> filesystem was
            mentioned briefly above. One may wonder how <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code> knows about the devices present on a
            system and what device numbers should be used for them. Drivers
            that have been compiled into the kernel directly register their
            objects with a <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> (devtmpfs
            internally) as they are detected by the kernel. For drivers
            compiled as modules, this registration will happen when the
            module is loaded. Once the <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            filesystem is mounted (on /sys), data which the drivers register
            with <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> are available to
            userspace processes and to udevd for processing (including
            modifications to device nodes).

            7.3.2.2. Device Node Creation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device files are created by the kernel by the <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> filesystem. Any driver that wishes
            to register a device node will go through the <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> (via the driver core) to do it. When
            a <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code> instance is mounted on
            <code class="filename">/dev</code>, the device node will
            initially be created with a fixed name, permissions, and owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short time later, the kernel will send a uevent to <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span>. Based on the rules
            specified in the files within the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d</code>, <code class=
            "filename">/lib/udev/rules.d</code>, and <code class=
            "filename">/run/udev/rules.d</code> directories, <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will create additional
            symlinks to the device node, or change its permissions, owner, or
            group, or modify the internal <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> database entry (name) for
            that object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules in these three directories are numbered and all three
            directories are merged together. If <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> can't find a rule for the
            device it is creating, it will leave the permissions and
            ownership at whatever <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code>
            used initially.

            7.3.2.3. Module Loading
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into
            them. Aliases are visible in the output of the <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> program and are usually
            related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices supported by a
            module. For example, the <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span> driver supports PCI devices
            with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of
            <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</span>&rdquo;</span>.
            For most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver
            that would handle the device via <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. E.g., the <code class=
            "filename">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</code> file
            might contain the string <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</span>&rdquo;</span>.
            The default rules provided with Udev will cause <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> to call out to
            <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe</strong></span> with
            the contents of the <code class="envar">MODALIAS</code> uevent
            environment variable (which should be the same as the contents of
            the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in sysfs), thus
            loading all modules whose aliases match this string after
            wildcard expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, this means that, in addition to <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
            <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> driver will be
            loaded if it is available. See below for ways in which the
            loading of unwanted drivers can be prevented.

          <p>
            The kernel itself is also able to load modules for network
            protocols, filesystems and NLS support on demand.

          7.3.3. Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically
          creating device nodes.
        </p>
        <div class="sect3">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            7.3.3.1. A kernel module is not loaded automatically
          </h3>
          <p>
            Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and
            the bus driver properly exports the necessary aliases to
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>. In other cases, one should
            arrange module loading by other means. With Linux-4.9.9, Udev is
            known to load properly-written drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB,
            SCSI, SERIO, and FireWire devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary
            support for Udev, run <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> with the module name as
            the argument. Now try locating the device directory under
            <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code> and check whether there is
            a <code class="filename">modalias</code> file there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file exists in
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>, the driver supports the
            device and can talk to it directly, but doesn't have the alias,
            it is a bug in the driver. Load the driver without the help from
            Udev and expect the issue to be fixed later.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is no <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in the
            relevant directory under <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code>,
            this means that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias
            support to this bus type. With Linux-4.9.9, this is the case with
            ISA busses. Expect this issue to be fixed in later kernel
            versions.

            of <span class="emphasis"><em>snd-pcm</em></span> by making the
            sound cards available to OSS applications), configure
            <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> to load
            the wrapper after Udev loads the wrapped module. To do this, add
            a <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=

            "replaceable"><code>&lt;filename&gt;</code></em>.conf</code>
            file. For example:

          <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">softdep snd-pcm post: snd-pcm-oss</code>

          <p>
            Note that the <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">softdep</span>&rdquo;</span> command also allows
            <code class="literal">pre:</code> dependencies, or a mixture of
            both <code class="literal">pre:</code> and <code class=
            "literal">post:</code>. See the <code class=

          </p>
          <p>
            If the module in question is not a wrapper and is useful by
            itself, configure the <span class=
            "command"><strong>modules</strong></span> bootscript to load this
            module on system boot. To do this, add the module name to the
            <code class="filename">/etc/sysconfig/modules</code> file on a
            separate line. This works for wrapper modules too, but is
            suboptimal in that case.

            Udev has no information needed to create a device node if a
            kernel driver does not export its data to <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. This is most common with third party
            drivers from outside the kernel tree. Create a static device node
            in <code class="filename">/lib/udev/devices</code> with the
            appropriate major/minor numbers (see the file <code class=
            "filename">devices.txt</code> inside the kernel documentation or
            the documentation provided by the third party driver vendor). The
            static device node will be copied to <code class=
            "filename">/dev</code> by <span class=
            "command"><strong>udev</strong></span>.

            This is due to the fact that Udev, by design, handles uevents and
            loads modules in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order.
            This will never be <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
            "quote">fixed</span>&rdquo;</span>. You should not rely upon the
            kernel device names being stable. Instead, create your own rules
            that make symlinks with stable names based on some stable
            attributes of the device, such as a serial number or the output
            of various *_id utilities installed by Udev. See <a class="xref"
