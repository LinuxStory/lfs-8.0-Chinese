        Introduction
      </h1>
      <p>
        This chapter includes a list of packages that need to be downloaded
        in order to build a basic Linux system. The listed version numbers
        correspond to versions of the software that are known to work, and
        this book is based on their use. We highly recommend against using
        newer versions because the build commands for one version may not
        work with a newer version. The newest package versions may also have
        problems that require work-arounds. These work-arounds will be
        developed and stabilized in the development version of the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download locations may not always be accessible. If a download
        location has changed since this book was published, Google (<a class=
        "ulink" href="http://www.google.com/">http://www.google.com/</a>)
        provides a useful search engine for most packages. If this search is
        unsuccessful, try one of the alternative means of downloading
        discussed at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html#packages">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/packages.html#packages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Downloaded packages and patches will need to be stored somewhere that
        is conveniently available throughout the entire build. A working
        directory is also required to unpack the sources and build them.
        <code class="filename">$LFS/sources</code> can be used both as the
        place to store the tarballs and patches and as a working directory.
        By using this directory, the required elements will be located on the
        LFS partition and will be available during all stages of the building
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        To create this directory, execute the following command, as user
        <code class="systemitem">root</code>, before starting the download
        session:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">mkdir -v $LFS/sources</kbd>
</pre>
      <p>
        Make this directory writable and sticky. <span class=
        "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">Sticky</span>&rdquo;</span> means
        that even if multiple users have write permission on a directory,
        only the owner of a file can delete the file within a sticky
        directory. The following command will enable the write and sticky
        modes:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">chmod -v a+wt $LFS/sources</kbd>
</pre>
      <p>
        An easy way to download all of the packages and patches is by using
        <a class="ulink" href="../wget-list">wget-list</a> as an input to
        <span class="command"><strong>wget</strong></span>. For example:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class=
"command">wget --input-file=wget-list --continue --directory-prefix=$LFS/sources</kbd>
</pre>
      <p>
        Additionally, starting with LFS-7.0, there is a separate file,
        <a class="ulink" href="../md5sums">md5sums</a>, which can be used to
        verify that all the correct packages are available before proceeding.
        Place that file in <code class="filename">$LFS/sources</code> and
        run:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">pushd $LFS/sources
md5sum -c md5sums
popd</kbd>
</pre>
