        System
      </h1>
      <p>
        The LFS system will be built by using an already installed Linux
        distribution (such as Debian, OpenMandriva, Fedora, or openSUSE).
        This existing Linux system (the host) will be used as a starting
        point to provide necessary programs, including a compiler, linker,
        and shell, to build the new system. Select the <span class=
        "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">development</span>&rdquo;</span>
        option during the distribution installation to be able to access
        these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an alternative to installing a separate distribution onto your
        machine, you may wish to use a LiveCD from a commercial distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter02/chapter02.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Preparing the Host System">Chapter 2</a> of
        this book describes how to create a new Linux native partition and
        file system. This is the place where the new LFS system will be
        compiled and installed. <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter03/chapter03.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Packages and Patches">Chapter 3</a> explains
        which packages and patches need to be downloaded to build an LFS
        system and how to store them on the new file system. <a class="xref"
        href="../chapter04/chapter04.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Final Preparations">Chapter 4</a> discusses the
        setup of an appropriate working environment. Please read <a class=
        "xref" href="../chapter04/chapter04.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Final Preparations">Chapter 4</a> carefully as
        it explains several important issues you need be aware of before
        beginning to work your way through <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        explains the installation of a number of packages that will form the
        basic development suite (or toolchain) which is used to build the
        actual system in <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html"
        title="Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter
        6</a>. Some of these packages are needed to resolve circular
        dependencies&mdash;for example, to compile a compiler, you need a
        compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        also shows you how to build a first pass of the toolchain, including
        Binutils and GCC (first pass basically means these two core packages
        will be reinstalled). The next step is to build Glibc, the C library.
        Glibc will be compiled by the toolchain programs built in the first
        pass. Then, a second pass of the toolchain will be built. This time,
        the toolchain will be dynamically linked against the newly built
        Glibc. The remaining <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter 5</a>
        packages are built using this second pass toolchain. When this is
        done, the LFS installation process will no longer depend on the host
        distribution, with the exception of the running kernel.
      </p>
      <p>
        This effort to isolate the new system from the host distribution may
        seem excessive. A full technical explanation as to why this is done
        is provided in <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter05/toolchaintechnotes.html" title=
        "5.2.&nbsp;Toolchain Technical Notes">Section&nbsp;5.2,
        &ldquo;Toolchain Technical Notes&rdquo;</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">Chapter
        6</a>, the full LFS system is built. The <span class=
        "command"><strong>chroot</strong></span> (change root) program is
        used to enter a virtual environment and start a new shell whose root
        directory will be set to the LFS partition. This is very similar to
        rebooting and instructing the kernel to mount the LFS partition as
        the root partition. The system does not actually reboot, but instead
        uses <span class="command"><strong>chroot</strong></span> because
        creating a bootable system requires additional work which is not
        necessary just yet. The major advantage is that <span class=
        "quote">&ldquo;<span class="quote">chrooting</span>&rdquo;</span>
        allows you to continue using the host system while LFS is being
        built. While waiting for package compilations to complete, you can
        continue using your computer as normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To finish the installation, the basic system configuration is set up
        in <a class="xref" href="../chapter07/chapter07.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;7.&nbsp;System Configuration">Chapter 7</a>, and the
        kernel and boot loader are set up in <a class="xref" href=
        "../chapter08/chapter08.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;8.&nbsp;Making the LFS System Bootable">Chapter 8</a>.
        <a class="xref" href="../chapter09/chapter09.html" title=
        "Chapter&nbsp;9.&nbsp;The End">Chapter 9</a> contains information on
        continuing the LFS experience beyond this book. After the steps in
        this book have been implemented, the computer will be ready to reboot
        into the new LFS system.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the process in a nutshell. Detailed information on each step
        is discussed in the following chapters and package descriptions.
        Items that may seem complicated will be clarified, and everything
        will fall into place as you embark on the LFS adventure.
